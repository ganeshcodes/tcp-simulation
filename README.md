**TCP SIMULATION**

The division of network routing functionality into software layers had enabled network engineers to write modules that enable faster development, easier testing and smoother interfaces. Communications go across layers serving each neighbor with necessary details in a predetermined message format. Transport layer support multiple protocols including TCP, UDP, SCTP, FCP, etc.

Among the layers Transport Layer enables end-to-end data transfer by delivering data from an application to its remote peer. With its unique design feature it can support multiple applications and multiple users simultaneously. The most-used transport layer protocol is the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which provides connection-oriented reliable data delivery, duplicate data
suppression, congestion control, and flow control.

In this project, we will make up a three host system which are connected to each other using different links. Once the connections are established you have to communicate with each other and once the communication is over we will have to terminate the connection as well.
